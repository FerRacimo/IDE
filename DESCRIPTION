Description: The Integro-Difference Equation model is a linear, dynamical model used to model
   phenomena that evolve in space and in time. At the heart of the model is the kernel,
   which dictates how the process evolves from one time point to the next. Both process
   and parameter reduction are used to facilitate computation, and spatially-varying kernels
   are possible. Parameters are fitted by maximum likelihood, and estimation is carried out
   using an evolution algorithm.
